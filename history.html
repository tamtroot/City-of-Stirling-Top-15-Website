                            <p>The origins of the City of Stirling Top Fifteen Bowling Competition date back to 2002, when the Stirling Sports Council ceased organising the long-standing District Nine Top Fifteen tournament. In response, Peter M. Black stepped forward to preserve the tradition, rallying support from local clubs. With help from A. Deans, he sent letters to every club in District Nine, ultimately securing participation from eight clubs for the inaugural event.</p>
                            <p>Each club contributed a £10 entry fee, while the late Mr. Willie Jenkins generously donated £40, ensuring all funds were returned as prize money to the winners and runners-up. The first final was held at Polmaise Bowling Club, where Polmaise emerged victorious over Causewayhead Bowling Club.</p>

                            <p>To formalise the competition, Peter Black and A. Deans invited Neil Nairn and Alan Davidson of Dunblane Bowling Club to join the committee. Together, they drafted the group's first rules and constitution. A tradition was established to rotate the hosting of the final between participating clubs. Once a club hosted the final, they would move to the bottom of the list for future hosting opportunities.</p>

                            <p>In 2003, 15 clubs entered the competition. A new trophy bearing the City of Stirling Top Fifteen crest was commissioned, funded by selling "spot the team" cards. Polmaise, as the first winners, were the first name engraved.</p>
